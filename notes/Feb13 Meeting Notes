Meeting Notes for Feb 13, 2019

- today is big picture project attack.

- want to have a set schedule with task deadlines, we both have a busy term and
don't want things to get ahead of us.

- laying out big picture implementation today, going to break tasks down to smaller
deliverables when we meet next week and begin coding.

We aren't sure what we're going to do for graphics yet, narrowed down to two options:
1. Text Based - CLI.
  pros:
  easier to develop in the short term.
  Quick to prototype and test.
  No huge learning curve.
  cons:
  difficult to display enough information in concise and easily readable format.
  cumbersome and possibly overwhelming control options.

2. Qt graphics
  pros:
  more graphically appealing application
  easier for players to use
  better for displaying information.

  cons:
  learning curve, we don't have any experience here.
  could lead to more difficult in implementing backend/frontend.
  collaboration could be more difficult.

We decided we will each run though some Qt tutorials over the weekend so we
have a better idea of what to expect.

Next we went though the large classes we'll need for the game,
everything was written on a whiteboard but I'm copying down here as well.
