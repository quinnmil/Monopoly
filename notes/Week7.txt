Meeting Notes for 2/24. Week 7.

Began discussion by covering last weeks/weekend progress in leaning QT and beginning 
development.

Quinn -
finished half of tutorial series, developed dice rolling "widget" as an
example of labels and buttons, dice rolling will eventually be implemented as
feature for the game. Ported basic class/header files into qt projects using
qMake, still cleaning up some of function prototypes. Want to preference qt
structures (like QList and QString) across the board.

Mason -
Didn't make it though many tutorials yet, had issues with Qt Creator installation.
Make outline header and class files for PropertyType, BoardType, PlayerType, and
GameType. Started work on TestMonopoly.ccp file which will use for preliminary testing
of class functions.


Plan for this week:

Quinn -
wants to have a working prototype of the application by Friday. Biggest
challenge is going to be creating the board visualization. going to spend some
time learning methods of Qt graphicsView. If this proves too intensive or not
necessarly for this project, could use qt built in visual classes like qbutton
and qlable. Going to be spending some time in the docs. Also going to nail down
game function order, ie: which buttons on the front end will create the game,
where is completion going to be checked. Ideally, player movement and display
is functioning by friday so that we can add features on top of this base structure
next week.

Mason -
Going to finish implementing backend functions as outlined in /2-23 tasks.
Need to get oriented with QT though tutorials and looking through the included
example projects. Begin desinging out game functins and features that will be used
for later features such as buyProperty(), tradeProperty(), goToJail(), etc.
