2/28 todo

A lot of what you were working on in testMonopoly needs to be implemented in respective classes. (Mostly the game class)

task1 : new game screen. There's a couple options for this:

1. have a button that when clicked opens a new window/overlay and prompts the user to create say how many players are playing.
2. have have these options displayed on the screen my default, hide the display after user has entered and clicked submit.

after submission, call the Game() constructer with proper arguments. This constructer should create the playerList and fill the gameSpaceList.
