# Monopoly
#### Authors: Quinn Milionis and Mason Jones
Final project for CIS 330 - University of Oregon

Basic "Monopoly" board game implemented in C++/Qt.
Gameplay mostly follows traditional Monopoly rules, with some differences and simplifications due to development time restrictions. Currently only implemented for two players, but code should be easily extendable.

### Installation
Monopoly requires [Qt 5](https://https://www.qt.io/download)
Instructions are for unix based systems,
(though application will run on Windows as well)

```
cd /Monopoly
qmake
make
open Monopoly.app/
```
Monopoly can also be openend via a GUI file explorer.
